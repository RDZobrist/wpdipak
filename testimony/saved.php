<br />
Saved…From what, you might  ask. To be “saved” means that you have  accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, and made Him Lord of your  life. In doing this, you have been saved  from an eternity in Hell, separated from God.  <br />
<ul>
          <li><strong>You can go to Heaven, no matter how bad your sin  is.</strong><br />
              <br />
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Matthew 9:13</strong> – “…for  I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&quot; </li>
              <li><strong>Luke  19:10</strong> – &quot;For  the Son  of  Man has come to seek and to save that  which was lost.&quot;<br />

                <strong>John  1:12</strong> – “But  as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of  God,  even to those who believe in His name.” </li>
