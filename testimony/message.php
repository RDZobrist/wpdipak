        Maybe life has come to a  crossroads for you, maybe you have hit rock bottom, or maybe you are at the top  and think that you need nothing more. The emptiness you feel inside, the despair is your need for Jesus. I  encourage you to make the decision to ask Jesus to take control of your life,  like I did when my shipmate told me I was going to Hell. It is the most important decision you will  ever make. You can ask Jesus to save you  and spend Eternity with Him or reject Him and spend an Eternity in Hell  separated from Jesus forever.<br />

        <strong>This is just the beginning of a  wonderful new life in Christ. To deepen  this relationship you should:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read  your Bible every day to know Christ better. </li>
          <li>Talk  to God in prayer every day. </li>
          <li>Tell  others about Christ. </li>
          <li>Worship,  fellowship and serve with other Christians in a church where Christ is  preached. </li>
          <li>As  Christ’s representative in a needy world, demonstrate your new life by your  love and concern for others. </li>
        </ul>
