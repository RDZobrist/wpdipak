        When  I was in the Navy at the end of the Korean War, one of my shipmates said,  “Hansen, you are going to hell.” He  explained how I was separated from God by my sins and that I needed to confess  and forsake my sins and to ask Jesus to forgive me of my sins and to come into  my life as my Savior. <br />

        <em>Salvation</em> is found in no one else, for there is no other name under Heaven that  has been given among men, <em><strong><u>by which we must be saved.</u></strong></em>  &#8212;Acts  4:12<br />
        <br />
        <strong>The Bible says that:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>God loves you and wants you to live with Him in Heaven. </strong> <br />
              <br />
              <ul>
              <li><strong>John 3:16</strong> – &quot;For God so loved the  world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall  not perish, but have eternal life.” </li>
